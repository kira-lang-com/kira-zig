Install notes:

- `zig build install` installs `kira` into `zig-out/bin/` by default and installs the active real toolchain into `~/.kira/toolchains/<channel>/<version>/`
- `zig build install-kirac` installs the same managed toolchain plus launcher flow without changing the rest of the repo install names
- `zig build install -p .local` installs into `.local/bin/` instead of `zig-out/bin/`
- `zig build` refreshes Foundation's generated FFI bindings inside the installed managed dev toolchain and preserves its compiled native-library cache; no manual Foundation `kira ffi autobind` pass is required
- `~/.kira/toolchains/current.toml` selects which real toolchain `kira` forwards to
- GitHub release archives ship the `kira` launcher separately from the managed toolchain payload; on first run, the release launcher downloads the matching `kira-toolchain-<platform>` archive into `~/.kira/toolchains/release/<version>/` and activates it automatically
- add the chosen launcher `bin/` directory to `PATH` to make direct `kira` invocation global for your shell session

CLI behavior:

- In an ANSI-capable terminal, `run`, `build`, `check`, and `test` render an in-place status surface with a command title and the six latest dependency, frontend, backend, linking, and test events. Redirected output remains plain and complete for scripts and CI; `--timings` keeps its explicit line-oriented diagnostic output instead of using the surface.
- Interactive `kira test` removes the scrolling surface on completion and prints only the combined `test result:` tally. Individual `CHECK`, `PASS`, `FAIL`, backend-result, and program-output lines remain available while the command runs in the six-line history and in full whenever output is redirected. The machine-readable tally is written to `.kira-build/test-report.json`.
- A successful `kira build` finishes with `Successfully built`; a failed build prints `Failed to build` followed by the normal structured compiler diagnostics. Artifact paths are not dumped into the final output.
- Build caches use one stable slot per source/backend under `.kira-build/cache/`. Input changes replace that slot instead of accumulating one content-hash directory per build.
- `fetch-llvm` reads `llvm-metadata.toml`, resolves the current host bundle, downloads the matching GitHub release asset, installs it into `~/.kira/toolchains/llvm/<llvm-version>/<target>/`, and skips when the install marker already matches
- `fetch-llvm --ci-metadata --json` prints Kira-owned machine-readable metadata for CI without downloading or extracting anything
- `fetch-llvm --archive <path>` installs a previously downloaded archive into the managed LLVM location using the same validation, extraction, marker, and layout rules as the normal fetch flow
- `run`, `build`, `check`, `tokens`, and `ast` default to the current directory and discover `package.kira` first, then legacy `kira.toml`, then legacy `project.toml`
- `run` defaults to the VM backend; `run --backend llvm` builds and runs a native executable
- `run --backend hybrid` builds a hybrid manifest, bytecode sidecar, and native shared library, then runs the mixed program in the hybrid host
- `run <target> --quit-after <duration>` starts the target and requests or enforces bounded shutdown after a positive duration such as `5s`, `5000ms`, or plain integer seconds. This is intended for non-disruptive bounded runs of graphical and long-running examples.
- `live <target> --quit-after <duration>` defaults to the desktop platform and starts a real live server/client session. The server builds a VM/live-loadable bundle graph under the selected target's `.kira-build/live/`, launches a live runner client, sends the bundle graph and bundle payloads, waits for client load/link/entrypoint events, waits for at least one rendered frame unless `--headless` is explicitly supplied, and then requests clean shutdown when the duration expires.
- `live desktop <target> --quit-after <duration>` is the explicit desktop spelling. The desktop runner window is visible for renderable apps/examples; `--quit-after` only bounds the session and does not bypass server/client handshake, bundle delivery, entrypoint start, or frame acknowledgement.
- `live desktop <target> --run-for <duration> --kill-after` is a legacy compatibility spelling. `--run-for` maps to the same bounded duration as `--quit-after`; `--kill-after` is retained as an emergency cleanup hint after graceful shutdown has been attempted.
- `live`, with no target, infers the current project/app target and defaults to the desktop runner. If the first positional after `live` is a known runner id, it is parsed as a runner; path-like values such as `./ios`, `../ios`, and `/tmp/ios` remain target paths.
- Runner ids are `desktop`, `macos`, `ios`, `tvos`, `visionos`, `windows`, `android`, `web`, and `linux`. Every runner id is accepted; incomplete host/device clients emit Kira-owned diagnostics instead of disappearing.
- `live web <target> --surface dom` runs the Kira Wasm DOM browser surface and writes browser artifacts under `.kira-build/live/runners/web-kira-wasm/`. `webgpu` writes a generated Wasm runtime module plus a WebGPU-capable canvas surface with browser capability detection, pipeline creation, and host frame-submission markers. Those `HOST_*` markers do not satisfy Kira Graphics frame or visible-content success. `hybrid` is modeled and rejected with a precise diagnostic until implemented.
- `live ios <target> --host 0.0.0.0 --port 42111` audits Xcode, iOS SDKs, and physical-device discovery. A physical iPhone must use a device-reachable endpoint such as the host LAN IP, not `localhost`; install/launch/signing gaps are reported as blocked device-runner diagnostics.
- Live root handling is explicit: invocation cwd, selected target root, Kira toolchain root, runner host path, generated live output root, and client runtime cwd are separate. The desktop runner host is resolved from the installed/development Kira toolchain; the selected example directory is never used as a Zig build root.
- Live reload currently uses full-bundle hot restart. On source changes, the server rebuilds the bundle graph, sends the full bundle set, and the already-running client restarts the app entrypoint without rebuilding or relaunching the runner process. Incremental bundle patching is reserved for a future protocol extension and is not documented as supported yet.
- Live clients consume `.klbundle` directories. The current layout includes a manifest, graph, metadata, diagnostics summary, bytecode/hybrid payloads, assets/resources, dependency graph information, version/hash metadata, and platform/surface metadata.
- `--headless` is only for non-window tests of the live protocol and reload loop. Normal desktop live sessions open a visible window when the platform can present one.
- `run`, `build`, and `check` automatically sync dependencies before compiling; add `--offline` or `--locked` when you want cache-only or lockfile-only behavior
- Library package roots are checkable and buildable, but not runnable or live-runnable. `kira run .` on a library emits `KCL020`; `kira live .` emits `KCL021`. Use an example or app target for execution.
- Examples and app packages are the runnable surface for CLI smoke tests. The real sibling-project matrix runs examples with `--quit-after` so graphical windows and live runners do not remain open.
- VM, LLVM/native, and hybrid now share the ordinary executable surface for control flow, calls, arrays, named values, and mixed runtime/native interaction
- `tokens` dumps lexer output
- `ast` dumps the parsed AST
- `check` runs parse and semantics
- `build` writes compiler artifacts into the project-local `.kira-build/` directory
- `shader check` runs the dedicated `.ksl` lexer, parser, import loader, semantic pass, and typed shader IR validation
- `shader ast` dumps the parsed KSL module shape without routing through the executable `.kira` frontend
- `shader build <file.ksl>` emits GLSL 330 vertex/fragment source plus reflection JSON into `.kira-build/shaders/` next to the source file by default, or `--out-dir <dir>`
- `shader build <file.ksl> --target wgsl|hlsl|msl|metal|spirv|spv` emits target-specific graphics shader artifacts plus reflection JSON. `glsl`, `glsl330`, and `glsl_330` select GLSL 330; `mlsl` and `metal` select MSL; `spir-v` and `spv` select textual SPIR-V assembly output.
- `shader build` with no explicit file discovers all top-level PascalCase `*.ksl` entry shaders under `Shaders/` in the current project root and writes outputs to `.kira-build/shaders/`
- `shader build` rejects compute shaders today with an explicit backend diagnostic because the current validated KSL lowerers are graphics shader paths, not compute-capable pipelines
- `instruments run <target>` builds the target through the normal pipeline, launches the selected backend as a child process, samples process metrics over the requested duration, prints a stable human report, and optionally writes stable JSON with `--json-out`
- `instruments run` accepts `--backend runtime|llvm|hybrid`, repeated `--track memory` and `--track cpu`, `--duration` values like `30s`, `1m`, or `500ms`, `--sample-rate` values like `10hz` or `2.5hz`, and `--fail-on-growth` byte thresholds like `10mb`, `512kb`, or `1048576`
- `instruments run --track memory` samples the child process private working set on Windows, which is the Task Manager-like resident private memory metric; JSON keeps the stable `rss_*` field names and includes `"metric": "private_working_set"` to document the measured source. On other platforms memory instrumentation fails clearly until platform samplers are added
- `instruments run --track cpu` reports measured CPU percent when enough samples are available, and reports CPU data as unavailable rather than inventing values when the run is too short or the platform data is not available
- `instruments run --fail-on-growth <bytes>` exits non-zero when measured memory growth is greater than the threshold; equality is treated as passing
- `sync` resolves registry, path, and git dependencies into `kira.lock`, verifies registry archive SHA-256 checksums, and populates the local cache under `~/.kira/cache/packages/`
- `add`, `remove`, and `update` edit the package manifest (`package.kira`, or legacy `kira.toml`) and then refresh `kira.lock`
- `package pack` writes a validated source-only `.tar` archive into `.kira-build/package/`
- `package inspect` prints manifest metadata and archive contents without extracting package scripts because package scripts are not supported
- `build --backend llvm` writes both a native object file and a native executable into `.kira-build/`
- `build --backend hybrid` writes a `.khm` hybrid manifest plus the bytecode, native object, and native shared library sidecars into `.kira-build/`
- `build --profile debug|profiler|release` selects the resolved profile backend. `profiles.profiler` is the profiling profile; `profiles.profile` is reserved/rejected.
- `export apple|macos|ios|tvos|visionos|windows|android|web|linux [target]` infers the current project/app target when omitted. `apple` emits the merged Xcode workspace; individual Apple exports reuse that system. Windows/Linux emit CMake/Ninja scaffolds, Android emits a Gradle scaffold, and Web emits Kira Wasm DOM HTML/JS/Wasm artifacts.
- `new` scaffolds either an app or a library package; use `new --lib` for a library template with `kind = "library"`, `module_root`, and a root module file under `app/`

LLVM backend selection is explicit and host-native. Discovery order is:

1. `KIRA_LLVM_HOME`
2. `~/.kira/toolchains/llvm/<llvm-version>/<target>/`
3. older repo-managed fallback paths if they already exist

The pinned LLVM fetch flow intentionally does not use checksum verification.
